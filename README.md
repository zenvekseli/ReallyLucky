# ReallyLucky
Creating this quite a simple app has caused a lot of distress and anxiety. At first I did not know how to make a functional do-while loop and once it was working, I accidentally moved the entire file to the bin. 
The game gives a player starting funds of 5 euros, and each round costs one euro. If the player gets one or more number sevens, they win more money (yay!). 
The game ends when the player either has no money left or they decide to stop by typing "e". 
The game also tells throughout the game how much money the player has left.

The game is called Lucky7, but the working title is ReallyLucky because I feel that this project has been powered by luck and a LOT of help from fellow students.
I hope playing this is a fun little journey. Creating this game has been the exact opposite.
